            <p>James is a philly based rapper. "Born of Kings" is what James Owk, pronounced "Ock", was taught at a very early age as he was raised up by two parents and older siblings who migrated to the United States as refugees from Cambodia, narrowly escaping the Khmer genocide known to the world as: The Killing Fields.</p>
            <p>From high school dropout to college graduate of Temple University located in North Philadelphia, Owk dabbled in his notepad until the realization came naturally that it was time to transform a passionate hobby into something more than just rapping for a few friends. With a plethora of local shows, and two EP's entitled "Amelia" and "SPTMBR" under his belt, Owk is ready to step out to the national and international stage to share his experiences through the music.</p>
