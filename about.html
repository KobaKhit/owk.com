            <p>James is a philly based rapper. "Born of Kings" is what James Owk, pronounced "Ock", was taught at a very early age as he was raised up by two parents and older siblings who migrated to the United States as refugees from Cambodia, narrowly escaping the Khmer genocide known to the world as: The Killing Fields.</p>
            <p>From high school dropout to college graduate of Temple University located in North Philadelphia, Owk dabbled in his notepad until the realization came naturally that it was time to transform a passionate hobby into something more than just rapping for a few friends. With a plethora of local shows, and two EP's entitled "Amelia" and "SPTMBR" under his belt, Owk is ready to step out to the national and international stage to share his experiences through the music.</p>

            <p>Originally from Russia, Koba came to the US to pursue the masters in Business Analytics. From a young age Koba was introduced to basketball and ever since he has been an avid baller. Through basketball he got exposed to hip hop for which he has genuine appreciation and utmost respect. While critical of modern day performers he believes that old school is the only school. Besides hip hop Koba is into EDM and knows the best EDM places in Philly.</p>
            <p>Being apt at all things technical Koba oversees all technological strategies, services, and products. With experience of working at tech startups he is now helping bring the Only With Kings brand into the limelight and learn a thing or two about entrepreneurship.</p>
