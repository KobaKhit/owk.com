            <p>James is a Philadelphia based creative entrepreneur. Raised by parents and siblings who migrated to the United States from Cambodia as refugees, James' first generation experiences have collected into a space where the idea of "hustle for your last name first" has materialized and pushed him into the avenue of fashion and the creative arts.</p>

            <p>A direct product of the Hip Hop universe is how James describes who he has become. Breaking social constructs to build bridges James is also an avid supporter of progressive education who also moonlights as a rapper whenever he catches the wave.</p>
